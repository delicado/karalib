* this will do a memory compacting for kar::karaoke class.
* advantage for implementing a memory compacting class.
* - all the song objects will not be fragmented in memory.
* - because only a single allocation is made, there will be less chance
* of having a memory allocation error. a result of frequently
* allocating memory. (i always encounter this kind of problem )
